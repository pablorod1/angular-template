          <p>As a result of growing greenhouse gas emissions, climate models predict that our planet will get
            significantly warmer, that ecosystems will be changed or destroyed, and that enormous human and economic
            costs will be incurred. These scenarios aren't guaranteed, but avoiding them will be very hard. We're trying
            to take small steps to mitigate our impact.</p>
